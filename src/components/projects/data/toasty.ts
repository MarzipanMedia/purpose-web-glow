  longDescription: "## Project Overview\n\nSmall businesses are the backbone of innovation, but standing out in today's competitive digital space can be a challenge. At Marzipan Media, we specialise in helping purpose-driven brands like Toasty, creators of the Ultimate Weatherproof Jacket, achieve their digital goals through strategic SEO.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nThis was quite a personal story with Toasty. They had a fantastic product – a jacket designed to withstand the harshest outdoor conditions – but when our Marzipan founder, Ben tried to purchase one online, he noticed the website may be holding them back from a speedy checkout process. Additionally, their digital visibility was limiting their reach.\n\nLike many new businesses with freshly launched websites, Toasty was starting from ground zero with their SEO, and their mobile site performance needed significant improvement to compete in today's mobile-first world.\n\n### Key Areas of Focus\n\n- Improving mobile site speed to enhance user experience\n- Building domain authority to establish trust and visibility\n- Increasing rankings for high-value keywords and phrases\n- Ironing out checkout process and email deliverability\n- Boosting their overall SEO score to improve discoverability\n\n## Our Solution\n\nWe implemented a targeted SEO strategy focused on both technical improvements and content optimisation:\n\n- Mobile performance optimisation\n- Strategic keyword targeting\n- Technical SEO fixes\n- Checkout process streamlining\n- Domain authority building\n\n## Results & Impact\n\nOver the course of the SEO sprint, we delivered tangible results that positioned Toasty for long-term success:\n\n### Mobile Site Speed\n- Improved their mobile site speed by 30%, ensuring users could navigate their site quickly and efficiently – a crucial factor for both user satisfaction and Google rankings\n\n### Domain Authority\n- Increased Toasty's domain authority from 1 to 8, laying the foundation for better rankings and greater trust from search engines\n\n### Keyword Rankings\n- By optimising content and targeting strategic keywords, we lifted a large number of key phrases an average of 12 places in search engine rankings\n\n### Overall SEO Score\n- Using tools like SEOability, we took their SEO score from 59 to 82, a significant leap that reflects their improved optimisation and readiness to compete in the market\n\n## Why SEO Is Essential for Small Businesses\n\nOur work with Toasty underscores the importance of ongoing SEO for small businesses:\n\n- Visibility and Discoverability: Ranking higher on search engines means being seen by the right people at the right time\n- Building Credibility: A strong domain authority signals to customers that Toasty is a reliable, established brand\n- Long-Term Benefits: Unlike short-term advertising campaigns, SEO offers sustainable growth\n- Improved User Experience: Enhancing mobile site speed and optimising the site layout not only improves rankings but also keeps users engaged\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur partnership with Toasty demonstrates the power of a well-executed SEO strategy. From technical improvements to keyword optimisation, every step we took was designed to position them as leaders in their industry. And while the results speak for themselves, this is only the beginning of Toasty's journey to becoming a household name in outdoor gear."
