  longDescription: "## Project Overview\n\nMarzipan Media was proud to be on the ground to capture the official opening of Wulugul Walk at Barangaroo – a long-awaited link along Sydney’s foreshore, now open to the public for the first time in generations.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nCommissioned by Infrastructure NSW, the goal was to produce a vibrant suite of video content that would showcase the beauty, cultural significance, and community impact of this new public space — while driving engagement across social media platforms.\n\n## Our Solution\n\nWulugul Walk connects Barangaroo Reserve in the north to Barangaroo House in the south, unlocking a continuous 11km harbourside promenade from Woolloomooloo to the Anzac Bridge.\n\nThe name Wulugul, meaning 'kingfish' in the local Aboriginal language, honours the site’s cultural roots. On a golden Sydney day, our team captured the spirit of this moment – interviewing locals, showcasing the landscape, and celebrating the harbour’s return to the people.\n\n### Production Approach\n\nShot on the Sony F7 and edited with social platforms in mind, our video content combined cinematic visuals with on-the-ground energy. We delivered punchy, engaging short-form videos optimised for social sharing and community engagement.\n\n## Results & Impact\n\nThe final suite of content included:\n- Launch Day coverage capturing the public’s first moments on the Walk\n- Vox pops, scenic edits, and multi-channel cutdowns for social media\n- Storytelling that honoured local Aboriginal heritage through thoughtful production\n\nThe campaign supported Infrastructure NSW’s goal of raising awareness and community pride, positioning Wulugul Walk as a must-visit destination for locals and tourists alike.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs an SCM2701 prequalified supplier, Marzipan Media is trusted by government and cultural institutions to deliver digital content that engages, inspires, and connects. This project highlights our ability to bring public spaces to life through meaningful video storytelling.",
