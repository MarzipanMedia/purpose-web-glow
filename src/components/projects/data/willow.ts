  longDescription: "## Project Overview\n\nWillow.org.au is one of Marzipan Media's most meaningful digital projects — a mobile-first microsite designed to provide legal information for women escaping violence or facing crisis.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nWomen in crisis situations often need immediate access to legal information under difficult circumstances — using shared devices, on slow connections, or with limited time and privacy. The solution needed to be fast, discreet, and accessible to users with low literacy or limited digital access.\n\n## Our Solution\n\nCommissioned by Women's Legal Service NSW and funded through state grants and community partnerships, Willow is a discreet and accessible WordPress site with specialized features for crisis situations.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- Safe Exit buttons for covert browsing\n- Automatic browser clearing to protect user history\n- Ultra-lightweight design prioritizing speed and safety\n- Low-literacy interface with clear, direct language\n- Optimized for slow 3G connections in rural NSW\n\n## Design Approach\n\nCollaboratively designed by women, the site's visual language — inspired by the resilience and flexibility of the willow tree — brings softness and strength to difficult content. The interface is calming, while remaining clear and direct.\n\n## Sustainability Impact\n\nWillow isn't only a lifeline — it's a model of Sustainable Web Design:\n- Emits just 0.46g of CO₂ per page view\n- Cleaner than over 50% of all websites globally\n- Lightweight design with reduced scripts and optimized assets\n\n## Results & Impact\n\nThe site provides critical information to women in need while demonstrating that crisis resources can be both effective and environmentally responsible. It serves as an ethical digital solution in both form and function.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWillow represents our commitment to creating technology that serves vulnerable communities while respecting both users and the planet. It shows how thoughtful digital design can address critical social needs without unnecessary environmental impact.",
