  longDescription: "## Project Overview\n\nIt was an honour to lead the digital transformation of the Royal Botanic Garden in Sydney – Australia's oldest scientific institution and a beloved public garden in the heart of the city.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nWith an outdated CMS, deteriorating UX, and poor accessibility, the Garden's online presence no longer reflected its importance. The site needed to match the beauty and significance of this 200-year-old institution.\n\n## Our Solution\n\nMarzipan Media, prequalified under the NSW SCM2701 scheme, stepped in to deliver a complete overhaul. For over six years, we've supported the Garden across social media, SEO, video production, and digital strategy.\n\nIn 2017, we worked in-house to lead a full website redevelopment across the Garden and its four sister sites, managing everything from:\n- Initial brief creation and tendering\n- Supplier coordination\n- Content strategy\n- User experience design\n- Implementation oversight\n- Testing and quality assurance\n- Go-live management\n\n## Key Deliverables\n\n- Content-first, image-led website with enhanced accessibility\n- Mobile responsive design optimized for visitors using the site while at the gardens\n- Rich storytelling tools to showcase the Garden's history and significance\n- Photography and drone footage capturing the Garden's beauty\n- Video production highlighting events and behind-the-scenes staff stories\n\n## Results & Impact\n\nThe result was the first time in the Garden's 200-year history that its digital presence truly matched the magic of its physical space. Our content creation strategy included work still seen throughout the Garden today, with highlights including video showcases of:\n- The Vivid Event\n- The Calyx building\n- The passionate staff behind the scenes\n\n## Ongoing Partnership\n\nOur journey continues with:\n- CRM integrations (Salesforce)\n- Team training and capability building\n- Ongoing digital strategy and support\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThrough thoughtful digital transformation, we've helped the Garden bloom online just as beautifully as it does in real life, preserving its legacy while making it accessible to new generations of visitors and plant enthusiasts.",
