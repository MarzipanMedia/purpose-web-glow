  longDescription: "## Project Overview\n\nAt Marzipan Media, we are proud to partner with the Museums of History NSW to create and execute impactful digital marketing campaigns. Our work has helped raise awareness for their incredible events and historical sites, driving audience engagement, growing digital communities, and surpassing ticket sales goals.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nA standout example is our work with the iconic Hyde Park Barracks Museum. Following its full refurbishment and reopening in 2020, we were engaged to build a comprehensive digital strategy with the aim of growing audiences, establishing a vibrant online community, and boosting visitation.\n\n## Our Solution\n\nStarting with zero followers, we launched a new Facebook page and crafted a mix of historical storytelling, image galleries, and engaging video content. Over an 8-week period, we built a strong digital community from the ground up — one that now serves as a key channel for engagement and promotions.\n\n## Implementation\n\nOur paid campaign strategy followed, targeting a wide range of audiences from local Sydneysiders to international tourists, CALD communities, and SLM members. With platform-specific content across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Google Search, the campaigns delivered 80% of all ticketing website traffic — surpassing sales targets before COVID-19 hit.\n\n## Results & Impact\n\nWe've also proudly managed campaigns for Sydney Open, Museums of History NSW's prestigious annual event, for four consecutive years. Our role includes content creation, storytelling, and digital ad strategy — driving awareness, building anticipation, and delivering strong conversion results.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFrom social-first storytelling to multi-channel ad execution, we understand the digital needs of cultural institutions. We tailor every campaign to highlight the unique stories, sites, and value these institutions bring to the public.\n\nIf you're looking to make history matter online, we're ready to help.",
