  longDescription: "## Project Overview\n\nIt's not every day you get help on projects that lift you higher, but that's exactly what happened when the House of Kitch invited us to create social media assets for Jarli, an award-winning short film to inspire Indigenous school children to reach for the stars.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nAustralia's sovereign space ambitions require developing a workforce with necessary STEM skills. With the space industry projected to triple in size by 2030, engaging school children, particularly Indigenous youth, and encouraging them to study STEM needs to start now.\n\n## Our Solution\n\nTogether we created digital content assets for Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for the launch of this beautiful animated film. Jarli is a proud Aboriginal girl with a knack for building things, especially things that fly.\n\n### The Film\n\nCreated by the Royal Australian Air Force and UTS_ALA to inspire kids to study STEM subjects and perhaps one day join the RAAF, 'Jarli' weaves visual and oral story elements to explore the dream of flight, indigenous astronomy, and the future of our planet and its people.\n\n### The Creative Team\n\nA talented team of Indigenous creatives included:\n- Co-director: Chantelle Murray\n- Writers: Jonathan Bell & Andrew Dillon\n- Voice actors: Madeleine Madden, Wayne Blair, Mark Coles Smith and Rahmah Bin Buyong\n\n## Our Contribution\n\nMarzipan created a range of social media assets for the film's release, including:\n- Animated GIFs\n- Interactive AR backgrounds for Instagram\n- Social media tiles\n- Campaign strategy and creative direction\n\n## Results & Impact\n\nJarli premiered at the Sydney Film Festival and was pre-screened to Aboriginal children from the Katherine community in outback Northern Territory on RAAF Base Tindal. The film later hitched a ride to the International Space Station on the NASA SpaceX Falcon 9 CRS-24 mission during National Science Week 2022.\n\nChief Defence Scientist, Professor Tanya Monro AC, noted that Jarli struck a chord because of her resilience, creativity and ingenuity—qualities the next generation of Australians need to harness to achieve extraordinary things.\n\n## Personal Connection\n\nProject timing coincided with Marzipan cofounder Ben Adams' experience fostering two young aboriginal children who had faced significant challenges. These kids, despite their experiences, still saw joy and wonder in the world. They loved watching Jarli and enjoyed our social media games, assets and creative that was created for the film.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nProjects born out of love, such as this one, help pave the way toward closing the gap and inspiring the next generation of Indigenous innovators and space explorers.",
