  longDescription: "## Project Overview\n\nOne of our favourite new clients has to be the Sydney Jewish Museum. We're proudly supporting their social media marketing, SEO and content creation. Working with cultural spaces has always been in our very foundations as a company. Having been lucky enough to work alongside many of Sydney's finest cultural spaces and places, we were thrilled that SJM got in touch toward the end of 2020.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nThe museum needed to increase their digital presence and reach new audiences in an increasingly digital world. They needed a partner who could navigate the complex cultural narratives while delivering measurable digital growth.\n\n## Our Solution\n\nWe have worked alongside the marketing team to produce amazing digital content for their Instagram Reels, optimise their website for search, and drive memberships and visitation through social media advertising and paid search campaigns on Google and Bing.\n\n### Key Achievements\n\n- In our first 6 months, we demonstrated an average month-on-month rise in organic traffic of around 25%\n- Significant community growth on their two social media platforms\n- Consistent growth in conversion rates on Adword Grants Management and Facebook Business Manager\n\n## Results & Impact\n\nWhat's been amazing is learning the stories here. The real-life tales that showcase the true spirit of human kindness. We're able to tell stories of hope, courage and survival in a way that can resonate with new audiences and inspire change for a new generation.\n\nWe're spreading kindness with our new Reels made for the Be a Mensch movement, sharing Holocaust survivor stories for the first time on their Reels, and handpicking tales from their blog for content adsâ€”stories that inspire acts of kindness and bravery while generating more traffic back to their website, more engagement with their brand and positive brand interactions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Museum is a must for anyone in the Sydney area, and we highly recommend taking a tour with one of the amazing volunteers, many of whom are direct descendants of survivors and able to retell the human stories of yesterday, giving history a voice for tomorrow.",
